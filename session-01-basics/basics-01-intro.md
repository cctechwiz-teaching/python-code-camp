## Basics > Intro

#### Welcome
- We are going to be learning Python.
- We are going to cover some basics with examples that you will get to code along with.
- We are going to finish each session with projects that we will start together, but that you will have to finish or expand upon on your own.

#### Current Experience
- Have any of you ever used Python before?
- What other programming experience do you have?

#### Script vs Interpreter
- Python can run in two ways, either in the interpreter (which we'll see in a minute), and from a script.

#### White space
- Python is a white space formated programming language.
- The indentation of each line is important.
