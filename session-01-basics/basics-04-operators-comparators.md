## Basics > Operators & Comparators

#### Operators
- = (assignment)
- \+ (addition)
- \- (subtraction)
- \* (multiplication)
- / (division)

- ** (power - exponents)

#### Comparators
- == (equal)
- \> (greater than)
- < (less than)
- \>= (greater than, or equal to)
- <= (less than, or equal to)

#### Built-In Functions
There are a number of built-in functions.
Some are found only on certain variable types (e.g. str.lower()), other can be used anywhere (e.g. print())
ipython is a great place to explore what you can do with a variable (var.<tab><tab>)
