## Project 02 - Choose Your Own Adventure

Let's get a little more advances and create a choose your own adventure game.

Let's first breakdown the components of the games and decide what we need to build.

#### Components
- There are rooms you can explore
- Each room has a description
- Each room as 1 or more exits you can take
- Each room as some items you can move around between rooms

#### Homework:
- add other interactions with the items in the rooms
- add more rooms
- add a command that reprints information about the room you are in
- add a command that tells you which directions you can exit
- add a command to print a map of the world
