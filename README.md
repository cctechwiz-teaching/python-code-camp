# Python3 Code Camp Material

### Code Camp 2019
[Info Page](https://cctechwiz.github.io/pages/code-camp-2019.html)

### Code Camp Overview
We will be coding in the latest version of Python, [Python3](https://www.python.org/), and using [GitHub](https://github.com/) so store and version our projects.

The main idea of this code camp is to first lay a solid foundation of Python programming fundamentals. Then provide brief introductions into various use cases and areas of application.

We cannot cover everything during the 3 hour sessions. You will get the most out of this experience if you take time between sessions to practice, explore, and build on the skills we covered. That is the primary reason that the camp is spread out over multiple weeks; to allow time for material to sink in via self-exploration, practice, and struggling; it is hightly encouraged that you do so! I will be available via email during the week to answer questions and help guide you towards discovering the solutions.

There are no grades and NO right or wrong answers to the projects or homeworks, just opportunities to have fun and solidify the concepts we discuss. There is no such thing as cheating (except for cheating yourself out of learning by just copying solutions), it is encouraged to search online for help solving problems, or to pair-program with friends working together on projects.

Dig deeper, be curious, break things (we’ll fix them), and make it enjoyable. You will get out of this camp what you put into it. I am here to facilitate, but whether or not you learn is up to you.

Let’s do this!


### Tentative Curriculum
I use the word tentative because I will more likely than change it up based on how each session goes to make sure it is a comfortable pace and challenge level for everyone. Additionally, I am always open to suggestions or feedback regarding what we are learning. This is your camp and I want you to feel like you’re learning and having fun.

- Session 1 - [Basics](./session-01-basics/basics-00-overview.md)
- Session 2 - [Beyond Basics](./session-02-beyond-basics/beyond-basics-00-overview.md)
- Session 3 - [Games](./session-03-games/games-00-overview.md)
- Session 4 - [Web](./session-04-web/web-00-overview.md)

There will be optional homework. These homeworks will be designed enhance your experience and increase your learning as mentioned above. Usually the homework will follow or add on to the project started during the session.
